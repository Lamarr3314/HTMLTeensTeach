            &emsp; In an attempt to analyze the public opinion of a topic
            combined with the actual function, humans haven’t yet come up with a
            straightforward formula. Instead, we tend to use the term,
            underrated and overrated, distinguishing something with a negative
            or lackluster public percephen with great value from something with
            and overwhelming public perception with underperforming function.
            When discussing whether something is overrated, there are typically
            three separate groups of individuals that use the term: those who
            have disappointed expectations, those who hate the discussed topic,
            and the bandwagon followers. All of these opinions combine to impact
            the status of a topic, whether it is overrated or not. But is there
            any legitimacy to this status?
            <br />
            &emsp;The beginning of the overrated web is the glorification of a
            position or subject. For instance, if an individual greatly values
            popularity and what it would be like to be famous, this is where
            something being overrated begins. As a result of this glorification,
            that individual works relentlessly to become famous, perfecting
            their craft until they have accomplished their goal. But in this
            transition to becoming famous, there is no sudden switch in
            environment or demeanor, but rather a gradual evolution of an
            individual and their public perception. Looking back to their
            original goal of fame, that individual realizes that they are pretty
            much the same as they were when they set out to achieve their
            dreams. Gradually, the reality of fame and popularity begins to fall
            short of their perceptions. From there, that individual believes
            that fame is overrated, simply due to the fact that they are still a
            similar individual, abiding by the same laws, in the same body. This
            is something that happens to many famous people across the world.
            For instance, when Billie Eillish set out with the goal of being a
            famous musician, she honed her craft, sacrificed her childhood, and
            eventually reached her goals. However, she often mentions how being
            famous is not exactly as she expected it to be, as she gave up her
            childhood for her dreams. However, the success of Billie Eillish
            begins to get envie from onlookers, who now want to do what she
            does. This in turns, restarts the cycle of something being
            overrated. <br />
            &emsp;However, this failed expectations of these individuals are not
            the only contributor to the perception of something being overrated.
            Much of this believe of something being overrated is based on the
            perception of the individual. This individual further pushes the
            idea that something is overrated, simply based on their beliefs.
            Going back to the Billie Eillish example, some individuals may
            dislike her music. This individual will see the success of Billie
            Eillish, listen to her music, and they just won’t like it. In their
            mind, things won’t add up, based on the popularity of Eillish, she
            must make amazing music. In reality, popularity and function are not
            linear. There is no exact equation that states that the more popular
            someone is, the better their music will be. As a result, when the
            magnitude of an individual’s popularity does not match up with their
            performance, something just doesn’t make sense. As a result, a
            narrative begins to form. Now, Billie Eillish is overrated. Slowly,
            that narrative begins to spread, expanding the overrated web.
            Throughout all of history, there tends to be an anti thesis as well
            as a thesis. This thesis will be well established and solidified
            throughout a long time span. However, gradually, there begins to be
            an anti thesis, led by contrasting minds, who believe in an
            alternative, the anti thesis. This same pattern occurs within social
            life. Some truly believe in the anti thesis, whereas others just
            want to be contrarian; just want to be different from the rest. When
            there is a large instance of popularity occurring within a product
            or individual, that is the thesis. However, as occurs within
            history, there is an opposition to this thesis. This opposition is
            the overrated narrative. Individuals see the widespread success of
            something and simply want to express an opposing idea. They desire
            to be different, just for the sake of being different. This
            contrarian narrative begins to spread, further spreading the
            overrated web. 
            <br>
            &emsp;The terms underrated and overrated, are utilized to
            establish a correlation between public perception of a subject or
            and individual and their actual value. However, this concept of
            something being overrated is largely arbitrary and presents three
            separate groups of individuals: those who have disappointed
            expectations, those who hate the discussed topic, and the bandwagon
            followers. These individual combine to create the overrated web, a
            dynamic cycle in which public perception is altered and as a result
            a narrative is formed.
